* Made debug mode a bit more thorough in not sending things to debug output.
* `make clean` actually cleans all of the output binaries now.
* Exclude some binary output from Git.
* Exclude VIM ".swp" files from Git.
* Add -Os to optimize for size, since BPF filters are space limited.
* Changed IPv4 map to a Trie, and added --prefix to the command line to specify larger subnets than /32.
* Added a testing framework (testbed.sh), to let me work on it in my VM.
