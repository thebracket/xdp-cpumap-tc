* Added a test to add 3 IPs and call "clear" to the list.
   * Noticed that the "clear" function only removes 2 of the 3.
* Added an ugly hack to make "clear" work; there's almost certainly a better way, added a TODO.

* Add and List are working for the command line tool.
* Matching appears to work.
* Made a mess with extra debug code that needs cleaning.

* Made debug mode a bit more thorough in not sending things to debug output.
* `make clean` actually cleans all of the output binaries now.
* Exclude some binary output from Git.
* Exclude VIM ".swp" files from Git.
* Add -Os to optimize for size, since BPF filters are space limited.
* Changed IPv4 map to a Trie, and added --prefix to the command line to specify larger subnets than /32.
* Added a testing framework (testbed.sh), to let me work on it in my VM.
